My Guess Who Game takes in a value from the array in which that value is randomly
selected. That value represents a person in which becomes who the user has to guess.
I incorporated images that corresponded to the characters of the game. In addition,
I added animations which took out the cards that did not meet the criteria of the
character that the user's questions were building.

I utiliized the concept of dynamically creating HTML elements. And I put alot of time
into the logic behind the game. Especially since it was a different approach then my
initial design.
